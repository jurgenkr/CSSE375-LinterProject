The plan for testing our system is as follows:
Unit Testing:
  - Using Mocks to limit external dependency, write unit tests for all bytecode representations and linter checks
  - Test edge case scenarios in all of these tests
  
Integration Testing:
  - Utilizing the already written unit tests, write integration tests that mimic realistic system states
  - Modify existing code to be more available to this level of testing
  
Acceptance Testing:
  - Using the console form of interacting with the system, write tests that mimic actual system states
  - Check correctness of the system by examining console output based on specific inputs
